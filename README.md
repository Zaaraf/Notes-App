React is a powerful JavaScript library that simplifies the process of building interactive user interfaces. It promotes the creation of reusable UI components, making it easier to manage complex applications.
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It helps catch type-related errors during development, making your code more robust and maintainable.
